# REQUIREMENTS
Similar to printing ‘Hello World’ in C or C++, the very first step towards programming a microcontroller is Blinking a LED with a delay. Atmega328 is a very popular high performance 8 bit AVR Microcontroller. For this example project we need to use two registers DDR and PORT. DDR stands for Data Direction Register, it determines the direction (Input/Output) of each pins on the microcontroller. HIGH at DDR register makes corresponding pin Output while LOW at DDR register makes corresponding pin Input. PORT register is the output register which determines the status of each pin of a particular port. HIGH at PORT register makes corresponding pin Logic HIGH (5V) while LOW at PORT register makes corresponding pin Logic LOW (0V).

# APPLICATIONS
Blinking LED circuit can be used for any visual sign indication in any highways or it can be used in advertisement 
hoarding also.
* LED blinking circuit can be used in signaling purpose (It can be used as signal for help, if you are in danger)
* LED blinking circuit can be used as flashing beacon.
* LED blinking circuit can be used as vehicle indicator when it is broke down in the middle of the road. 
* It can be used in operation theaters or offices as an indication that you are engaged in work.
* There are lots of applications with these two circuits.
